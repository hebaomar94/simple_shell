# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
![Betty style](https://img.shields.io/badge/betty-style%20guide-purple?style=round-square)

> This is an ALX collaboration project on Shell. We were tasked to create a simple shell that mimics the Bash shell. Our shell shall be called **hsh**

## General Requirement for project

- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All header files should be include guarded
- Write a README with the description of the project

## Description ##

**hsh** is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.

### How **hsh** works
* Prints a prompt and waits for a command from the user
* Creates a child process in which the command is checked
* Checks for built-ins, aliases in the PATH, and local executable programs
* The child process is replaced by the command, which accepts arguments
* When the command is done, the program returns to the parent process and prints the prompt
* The program is ready to receive a new command
* To exit: press Ctrl-D or enter "exit" (with or without a status)
* Works also in non interactive mode

## Allowed functions ##

* `access` (man 2 access)
* `chdir` (man 2 chdir)
* `close` (man 2 close)

* `isatty` (man 3 isatty)
* `kill` (man 2 kill)
* `malloc` (man 3 malloc)
* `open` (man 2 open)
* `opendir` (man 3 opendir)
* `perror` (man 3 perror)
* `read` (man 2 read)
* `readdir` (man 3 readdir)
* `signal` (man 2 signal)
* `stat` (__xstat) (man 2 stat)
* `lstat` (__lxstat) (man 2 lstat)
* `fstat` (__fxstat) (man 2 fstat)
